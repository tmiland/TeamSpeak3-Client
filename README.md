### Manual install

Installing TeamSpeak on Debian is very tedious, as there are no repositories or even native Deb packages users can download. Instead, if you want an installable TeamSpeak 3 client, youâ€™ll need to build the package yourself. To start the build process, open up a terminal and install the Git tool.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Using git, grab the latest code for the TeamSpeak 3 client package builder:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tmiland/TeamSpeak3-Client.git
```

CD into the newly cloned git folder, and execute the build tool to generate a new package.

```shell
$ cd TeamSpeak3-Client
```

```shell
$ ./package.sh
```

Package.sh will build a DEB package according to your Architecture Type.

Use the dpkg command in terminal:

```shell
sudo dpkg -i teamspeak3-client_amd64.deb
```

or

```shell
sudo dpkg -i teamspeak3-client_i386.deb
```

Uninstall the TeamSpeak 3 client from Debian with:

```shell
sudo apt-get remove teamspeak3-client
```

If you're having dependency issues, run:

```shell
sudo aptitude install libc++1 libc++abi1 libqt5sql5 libqt5sql5-sqlite libsrtp0
```
